 * The spiral.

 * Every poster sits on a helix: card `i` is `i` steps around the axis and `i`
 * steps down it. Scrolling advances the whole helix by `N - 1` steps, so each
 * card in turn arrives at the front, flat to the viewer, while the ones either
 * side are turned away like pages of a carousel. The section is pinned for the
 * duration and the motion is scrubbed, so the helix is exactly as far along as
 * the reader is.
 *
 * It also turns on its own. The helix wraps modulo the card count, which makes
 * it endless, and a looping tween walks it forward whenever the section is on
 * screen (so the spiral is alive before anybody touches the page, and scroll
 * steers something already in motion rather than starting it.
 *
 * The scene is translated back by the helix radius so the front card sits at
 * z = 0) at the perspective's natural size: rather than being blown up by
 * being nearer the camera than the page.
