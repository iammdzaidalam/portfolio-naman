/**
 * A category's cover on the work wall.
 *
 * The still is the clip's own first second, so the card is never empty and
 * never jumps; pointing at it starts the clip over the top, and leaving stops
 * it and puts the still back.
 *
 * It is a plain div and not a button the way `Reel` is. This card sits inside
 * the link to the category, and a button inside a link is neither one thing
 * nor the other for a keyboard or a screen reader. So the clip here is
 * decoration on a link: hovering plays it, the keyboard gets the link, and the
 * clip itself is never the only way to reach anything.
 *
 * Sound is left off. On `Reel` the sound rides the hover because the clip is
 * the thing being looked at; here six covers share a screen and any one of
 * them could be crossed on the way to another.
