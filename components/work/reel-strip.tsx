 * The cut, not a still of it.
 *
 * These were shot vertically for a feed and they are shown vertically. A 9:16
 * clip dropped into the page's 16:9 hero would lose most of the frame, which is
 * the whole reason this is a shelf of its own rather than a swap.
 *
 * It borrows the shoot carousel's track so the scrolling, snapping and gutter
 * behave identically; with only a handful of clips it simply does not overflow.
 *
 * Sound rides the hover. Nothing plays or makes a noise on its own, but a clip
 * you point at comes up with its audio, because these were cut for a feed and
 * half of them are somebody talking. The switch in the corner is there for
 * anyone who would rather watch them silently, and it is the only thing on the
 * strip that persists between clips.
 *
 * A click opens the clip full screen, with the rest of the strip to move
 * through: a card this size is a thumbnail of something cut to fill a phone.
