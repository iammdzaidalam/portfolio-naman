/**
 * One of the client's clips. Nothing plays, and nothing makes a sound, until it
 * is asked for.
 *
 * Hovering starts it with the sound up; leaving stops it. A click opens it full
 * screen in the viewer, which is also the whole story on a touch screen, where
 * there is no hover to give.
 *
 * Click used to latch the clip playing in place. It was the wrong thing for a
 * card 200px wide holding footage cut for a phone: the reader had asked to
 * watch it, and the answer was to keep it small. Opening it is the answer to
 * the same question.
 *
 * Sound riding the hover is the reason `play()` has a fallback. A browser only
 * permits unmuted playback once the page has had a real user gesture, and a
 * hover is not one: before the visitor has clicked anything, an unmuted `play()`
 * is rejected outright. Rather than track gestures and guess, the call simply
 * tries with sound, and on rejection retries muted so the clip still plays. The
 * first click anywhere lifts the restriction and every hover after it has
 * audio.
 *
 * Nothing is fetched until it is wanted either: `preload="none"` means the only
 * thing on the wire is the poster, which is a real frame cut from the clip, so
 * the box is never empty and never jumps.
 *
 * It is a button, not a bare video, because it does something when you click
 * it: that gets keyboard operation and a screen-reader label for free.
