 *
 * The strip sits directly under the display on purpose. It used to be further
 * down the page with the reels in between, which meant choosing a frame changed
 * something the reader could no longer see.
 *
 * The display holds a constant HEIGHT and lets the width follow the frame. A
 * fixed 16:9 box was the obvious thing and it was wrong: this set is mostly
 * portrait, so `object-contain` put a wall of ink down either side of nearly
 * every frame, and `object-cover` would have cropped the tops off people. A
 * fixed height keeps every frame whole at its own proportions while the page
 * below stays exactly where it was, which is the only thing the fixed box was
 * really buying.
