 * the whole frame. The frame is fully black from frame 130 of 144 (5.417s at
 * 24fps) and holds black to the end at 6.0s.
 *
 * Everything here is in frame numbers, and the film's clock is rounded to
 * the nearest frame before any comparison. The browser reports a frame's
 * time to the microsecond, so frame 128 comes back as 5.333333, which is

 * so while it plays the surround is never seen and cannot fight it; this is
 * kept so that a bar, should a browser ever leave one, follows the frame
 * rather than sitting on it as a border. The frame's edges stay white far
 * longer than its mean does: the arch's black reaches the top edge at frame
 * 124 but the bottom edge and the corners only at frame 129, so until then a
 * white surround matches most of the seam and anything darker would make the
 * frame's last white slivers read as a border. Once the edges go, the top
 * and bottom edge rows average 27 on frame 129 and 0 on frame 130. The
 * surround takes the 27 one frame early, on frame 128. A style written from
 * the frame callback reaches the screen with its frame when the main thread
 * is free and a composite or two later when it is busy, and frame 128's thin
 * white slivers on a near-black surround for one frame are a far smaller
 * mismatch than frame 129, all but black, sitting on white for two
 * composites. Held per frame rather than interpolated, because the frame

        The surface: the film's white, then the black the film ends on, then
        paper once the mark has developed. The film sits inside it so the wipe
        takes both. No grain during the film: the surround has to be the same
        flat white as the frame, so that until the first frame decodes there
        is nothing to mark where the film will be.

        The film covers the panel, centred, whatever shape the viewport is: a
        screen wider than 16:9 loses rows off the top and bottom of the frame
        (2560x1080 loses an eighth of each, the crown of the memorial's dome
        and the nearest stretch of road), a taller one loses columns off the
        sides (a phone keeps the middle quarter to a third: the road, the
        bridge deck, the tram until it passes the camera, and the arch, whose
        interior is the black the frame ends on). The frame is composed on
        its centre line, so either crop keeps the picture, and no viewport
        ever shows a bar on any edge. One rule rather than a breakpoint,
        because on a wide screen cover is exactly the old full-width rule,
        and a breakpoint would only add an edge to get wrong.

          at 55 percent of the width (measured at 682 to 712 px of 1280 across
          the film), so a crop centred on the frame put the road a sixth of a
          phone screen to the right. 57 percent lands the road on the middle
          of every portrait window (390x844 wants 56.8, 375x667 57.3, an iPad
          58.2) and on a landscape screen, which crops only a sliver from the
          sides, it moves the picture by a few pixels.
