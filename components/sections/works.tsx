 * The work.

 * The section label sticks to the top and spreads its letters across the page
 * as you scroll, then gathers in the right corner. Below it the pieces run in
 * two columns that are deliberately out of step: the right column starts with
 * the page's one large statement and each item carries a different top offset,
 * so the eye moves down the page in a zigzag rather than a grid. Every item is
 * a tiny mono caption, a sentence-case title, then the image.

/**
 * Top offsets alternate so no two neighbours align. The shapes alternate too,
 * 4:3 against 3:4 against 1:1, but they are not set here: the client cut the
 * six home covers (`HOME_COVERS`) to exactly those shapes, so each card takes
 * its cover's own ratio and shows the whole artwork. A card without a home
 * cover falls back to the wall's cover and its shape.
