/**
 * The client's photography, grouped by shoot.
 *
 * Generated from their "website content" drive: every frame they supplied is
 * here, none is used twice, and the alt text is a description of what is
 * actually in the picture rather than of the folder it arrived in. Within a
 * shoot the strongest frame opens the strip and the rest follow behind it.
 *
 * Dimensions are the real ones, which the carousel needs: slides share a height
 * and take their width from the frame, so portrait and landscape can sit in the
 * same strip without either being cropped to fit.
